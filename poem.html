        <p class="intro">Married in '06 
        </br> Took many pics 
        </br> 14 years together 
        </br> But it feels like forever 
        </br> They sometimes have fights 
        </br> But they are quick and concise 
        </br> While their love has no bounds
        </br> And lots of mounds</p>
